# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is software that allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files. It is useful because with version control you can mergre revisions made by different people.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

When you create a git repository a Master branch is created. A branch is a folder or line where code is stored and edited in. You would want to use a  or create your own feature branch because this is where you can write and revis your own code that will later be merged back the the master branch along with other peoples branches that contain their own code and revisions.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit creates a save point in Git. A good commit message is a message that communicates about the changes that were made to other developers so it is easily readable and they can understand why the changes were made. Detail and good grammar is important in a good commit message.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged. This would take place when you give commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch's.
