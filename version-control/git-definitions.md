# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?

Version control records different version of the same file or files so they can be accessed at anytime in the future. It's useful for seeing what has changed over time in the files.

a branch is a copy of the master version that can be worked on without messing up the master. I would use one to make changes to a file without changing the master version so I could experiment with what I wanted to do.

a committ is making a change to the branch you are working on, basically they are saves you make to your branch. A committ message should explain what was changed in the file with a clear and consice sentence.

A merge conflict is when you merge files and there are conlficts within the files, such as two people made changes to the same line on the file. Git doesn't know what to do so you have to tell it which one is correct.

this is a change to this file.
